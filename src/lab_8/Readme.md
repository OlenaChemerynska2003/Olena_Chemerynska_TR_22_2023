# Laboratory work 8

# Description

1. We create the FileWriter and FileReader classes. We implement a program that writes a sequence of random numbers in the range specified using the command line parameters to a file (txt type). We also specify the file name in the command line. The program provides a check for the existence of a file with a given name.
   To generate a random number within [b1,b2], we use the formula new Random().nextInt(b2-b1+1)+b1.
2. We read information from the file created in the previous task. We display it on the console.
